# spambase

### What the code should have
Go to the UCI Machine Learning repository and download the Spambase dataset. Make sure you read the documentation for the data. Load in the data file, doing any cleaning necessary to get usable data.

Subsample the data set so 60% is training data and 40% is test data. You can subsample however you like, including splitting the original file. Just make sure that you have a representative data set. (The original is about 60% not-spam and 40% spam.)

Then, write code to classify the data into spam and not-spam, training with your training data and testing on your test data.
